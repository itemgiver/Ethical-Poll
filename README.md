# Ethical Poll

Ethical-Poll is a webpage where people can post ethical questions and share their thoughts. This webpage was designed to give more opportunities for people to explore and discuss topics of computer science ethics. Our target users are people who conduct computer science research and aim to help them conduct related ethical research preceding the research.

## Expected Outcomes

We expect the following outcomes from our project:

- People’s perceptions of related ethical issues can be investigated before conducting computer science research. As ethics and ethical issues become more and more important in computer science research, we hope that our website can help users obtain information about people’s views on ethical issues.
- By asking questions that users are interested in and getting results, users will be able to better understand their position on ethical issues.
- We expect it to encourage and guide users to set up their virtues in computer ethics.
